‚ú® Dynamic Learning Pathway Generator ‚ú®
üöÄ Overview
The Dynamic Learning Pathway Generator is an innovative full-stack application designed to provide personalized and adaptive learning experiences. In an era of information overload, this MVP demonstrates a unique approach to skill acquisition by dynamically curating learning resources based on user input (skill and proficiency level). It's a foundational step towards an intelligent "cognitive co-pilot" for personalized education.

This project showcases a modern full-stack architecture, leveraging a React frontend for an intuitive user interface and a Node.js Express backend (converted to Netlify Functions for serverless deployment) to serve dynamic content.

üåü Features
Personalized Pathway Generation: Dynamically generates a sequence of learning resources (videos, articles, quizzes) based on selected skill and proficiency level (Beginner, Intermediate).
Interactive Progress Tracking: Users can mark resources as complete or submit simulated quizzes to advance through the pathway.
Adaptive Logic (MVP): Simple backend logic simulates adaptation, suggesting the next relevant resource based on quiz outcomes.
Beautiful & Responsive UI: Crafted with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and visually appealing user experience across devices.
Full-Stack Architecture: Demonstrates seamless communication between a React frontend and a Node.js backend.
Serverless Deployment: Backend logic is deployed as Netlify Functions, showcasing modern cloud deployment practices.
üí° Why This Project?
This project addresses the challenge of generic online learning by proposing a system that adapts to the individual learner. It's a proof-of-concept for a tool that could significantly ease human life by making skill acquisition more efficient and engaging, moving towards a truly personalized educational future.
